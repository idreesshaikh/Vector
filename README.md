# Vector
**Vector** is an abstract data type, which is differ from list in their access properties. A vector is a random access data structure, whereas lists are strictly sequential access. With a list of a thousand elements it takes longer to access the last element than the first, but with a vector the times are the same. Vector can be treated as an array of objects, where each object can be accessed by its index. Vector data type supports all the standard operations as array, such as accessing elements by index value, key searching, counting and sorting elements.
